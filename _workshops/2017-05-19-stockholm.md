goals:
       Does writing code and scripts play an important role in your research? 
       Do you have the feeling that there is room for improvement in your
       programming practices? The CodeRefinery project is organizing an
       afternoon get-together for researchers in the Stockholm region where
       the focus will be on exchanging ideas and discussing common problems
       encountered when developing code for research - and how to go about
       solving them.
format:
       One afternoon event starting with a seminar and followed by discussions. 
       Participants can bring their own material to present.
